            To glorify God through the training and the nurturing of students in
            their spiritual, academic, physical, emotional, and social
            development. This is achieved through a Christ-centered education
            based on biblical truth, which leads to the formation of the
            character of God within. God’s character impacts wisdom, knowledge,
            and love, helping our school community to develop a world-view that
            will impact the world for Christ.
